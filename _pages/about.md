As a Mechatronics Engineer with a complementary Associate of Science in Computer Science, I specialize in transforming complex ideas into tangible realities. My experience spans from designing large-format 3D printers using C++ and developing robotic educational platforms in C# to the hands-on manufacturing of prototypes with CNC, SLA, and laser cutting equipment.

I am proficient in using programming languages like Python for data analysis and G-code for fabrication. This unique blend of skills is showcased in my graduation project: an IoT weather station built for extreme conditions, which included developing a dashboard for real-time data interpretation.

Beyond my technical work, I explore my creative side through photography and digital art, using tools like Illustrator and Photoshop to bring imaginative 3D printed projects to life. I’m always excited to connect and collaborate—don’t hesitate to get in touch if you’d like to join forces on exciting projects!
